## Educational Blockchain Implementation in Go with Advanced Consensus

Welcome to go-basic-blockchain, an educational project designed to demystify blockchain technology through a hands-on, from-scratch implementation in Go. This project serves as a comprehensive learning tool for developers, students, and blockchain enthusiasts who want to understand the fundamental mechanics of blockchain systems.

**üöÄ NEW: Advanced Helios Consensus Algorithm** - This project now includes a sophisticated three-stage consensus mechanism with sidechain routing, proof validation, and dynamic difficulty adjustment.

Key Features:
- **Built from Scratch**: Every component of this blockchain is implemented from the ground up, without relying on third-party blockchain libraries
- **Advanced Consensus**: Implements the Helios consensus algorithm with three-stage validation
- **Go Programming Language**: Utilizing Go's simplicity and efficiency for complex systems
- **Readable JSON Format**: Human-readable JSON for data structures and storage
- **No Third-Party Dependencies**: Encourages deep understanding of core blockchain concepts
- **Educational Focus**: Thoroughly commented and documented with design explanations
- **Optimized Test Suite**: Fast, reliable tests with smart scrypt configuration
- **Sidechain Routing**: Advanced transaction routing through specialized protocols

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental structure of a blockchain
- Implement core blockchain components: blocks, transactions, wallets, and mining
- Explore advanced consensus mechanisms (Helios algorithm)
- Learn about cryptographic principles used in blockchain technology
- Gain insights into blockchain data structures and their implementations
- Understand sidechain routing and proof validation systems

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-basic-blockchain.git
   cd go-basic-blockchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run tests to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. Start the blockchain node:

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Helios Consensus Algorithm

The project implements the **Helios consensus algorithm**, a sophisticated three-stage consensus mechanism:

1. **Stage 1 - Proof Generation**: Miners create cryptographic proofs for transaction validation
2. **Stage 2 - Sidechain Routing**: Transactions are routed through specialized protocols (BANK, MESSAGE, etc.)
3. **Stage 3 - Block Finalization**: Validated blocks are finalized with proof verification

### Key Components

- **Blockchain Core**: Main blockchain implementation with Helios integration
- **Wallet System**: Encrypted wallet management with key derivation
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with authentication middleware
- **P2P Network**: Peer-to-peer communication framework
- **Sidechain Router**: Transaction routing through specialized protocols
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing with optimized performance
