C) Provide meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes  
D) Never return error responses

### **Question 8: Testing Strategy**
What is the recommended testing strategy for blockchain applications?

A) Only test the happy path  
B) Test only the backend  
C) Use a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests  
D) Skip testing entirely

## **True/False Questions**

### **Question 9**
Integration testing should only be done after all unit tests pass.

### **Question 10**
Performance testing is only important for high-traffic applications.

### **Question 11**
API documentation should be updated whenever the API changes.

### **Question 12**
End-to-end testing can replace unit testing entirely.

### **Question 13**
Error handling should be consistent across all API endpoints.

### **Question 14**
Test data should be realistic and representative of production data.
