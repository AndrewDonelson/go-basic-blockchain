D) To centralize control

### **Question 7: Network Topology**
What type of network topology is most common in P2P blockchain networks?

A) Star topology  
B) Mesh topology  
C) Ring topology  
D) Bus topology

## **True/False Questions**

### **Question 9**
P2P networks require a central authority to function.

### **Question 10**
Node discovery can happen automatically without manual configuration.

### **Question 11**
Consensus protocols are only needed for high-value transactions.

### **Question 12**
P2P networks are more resilient to single points of failure than centralized networks.

### **Question 13**
Message broadcasting sends messages to all connected peers.

### **Question 14**
Network synchronization only happens when new blocks are mined.

## **Practical Questions**

### **Question 15: Basic P2P Node Implementation**
Create a basic P2P node that can:
- Start and listen for incoming connections
- Connect to other nodes
- Send and receive simple messages
- Handle peer lifecycle (connect/disconnect)

### **Question 16: Node Discovery System**
Implement a node discovery system that:
- Uses bootstrap nodes for initial discovery
- Exchanges peer lists with connected nodes
- Automatically connects to new peers
- Handles peer failures and reconnection

### **Question 17: Message Routing System**
Create a message routing system that:
- Handles different message types (ping, block, transaction)
- Broadcasts messages to all peers
- Routes messages to specific peers
- Implements message validation and error handling

### **Question 18: Consensus Protocol Implementation**
Implement a basic consensus protocol that:
- Proposes new blocks to the network
- Collects votes from peers
- Reaches agreement on block validity
- Handles consensus failures and recovery
