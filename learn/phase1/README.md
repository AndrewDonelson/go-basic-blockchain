# Phase 1: Foundation

## üèóÔ∏è Building the Foundation

Welcome to Phase 1! This phase focuses on building a solid foundation in Go programming and blockchain fundamentals. By the end of this phase, you'll have a basic but functional blockchain implementation.

### **What You'll Learn in Phase 1**

- **Go Programming Fundamentals**: Master the basics of Go syntax, data structures, and programming patterns
- **Blockchain Theory**: Understand the core concepts behind blockchain technology
- **Core Data Structures**: Build the fundamental building blocks of your blockchain
- **Basic Implementation**: Create your first working blockchain with mining capabilities
- **Testing Fundamentals**: Learn how to write effective tests for your blockchain

### **Phase 1 Sections**

#### **Section 1: Course Introduction & Setup**
- Course overview and learning objectives
- Development environment setup
- Project structure walkthrough
- Git basics and version control

#### **Section 2: Go Fundamentals for Blockchain**
- Go basics review (structs, interfaces, goroutines, channels)
- Cryptographic libraries in Go
- JSON handling and serialization
- File I/O and persistence
- Error handling patterns
- Testing in Go

#### **Section 3: Blockchain Fundamentals**
- What is a blockchain? (theory and concepts)
- Block structure and linking
- Cryptographic hashing and digital signatures
- Consensus mechanisms overview
- Transaction types and validation

#### **Section 4: Core Data Structures**
- Building the Block struct
- Transaction interfaces and implementations
- Wallet system design
- Address generation and validation
- PUID (Persistent Unique ID) system

#### **Section 5: Basic Blockchain Implementation**
- Creating the genesis block
- Block mining with proof-of-work
- Transaction queue management
- Block validation and chain integrity
- Basic persistence layer
- First working blockchain

### **Phase 1 Learning Objectives**

By the end of Phase 1, you will be able to:

‚úÖ Set up a complete Go development environment
‚úÖ Write clean, idiomatic Go code
‚úÖ Understand blockchain architecture and principles
‚úÖ Implement core blockchain data structures
‚úÖ Create a basic working blockchain with mining
‚úÖ Write comprehensive tests for your code
‚úÖ Use Git for version control effectively

### **Phase 1 Project**

Your Phase 1 project will be a **Basic Blockchain Implementation** that includes:

- A complete blockchain with block linking
- Basic proof-of-work mining
- Transaction processing
- Wallet creation and management
- Data persistence
- Comprehensive testing
