## **True/False Questions**

### **Question 9**
Blockchain data is immutable, meaning once recorded, it cannot be changed.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 10**
In a blockchain, all transactions are visible to all participants, making it completely transparent.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 11**
Proof of Stake (PoS) requires miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles like Proof of Work.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 12**
Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography with public and private key pairs.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 13**
A 51% attack occurs when an attacker controls more than half of the network's mining power.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 14**
Double spending is prevented by waiting for multiple block confirmations.

**True** / **False**

## **Practical Questions**

### **Question 15: Block Structure**
Create a complete block structure with header and body components. Include all necessary fields and explain the purpose of each field.

### **Question 16: Chain Validation**
Write a function that validates the integrity of a blockchain by checking the linking between blocks and verifying hashes.

### **Question 17: Transaction Validation**
Implement a transaction validation function that checks for proper signatures, valid amounts, and prevents double spending.

### **Question 18: Consensus Mechanism**
Explain the differences between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake. Include advantages and disadvantages of each.
