A) Persistent Unique Identifier  
B) Public User ID  
C) Private Unique ID  
D) Permanent User Identifier

### **Question 5: Merkle Trees**
How do Merkle trees improve blockchain efficiency?

A) They reduce block size

### **Question 6: JSON Tags**
What does the `omitempty` tag do in Go struct JSON tags?

A) It makes the field required  
B) It omits the field from JSON output if it's empty  
C) It encrypts the field value  
D) It makes the field optional

### **Question 7: Block Validation**
What is the first step in validating a block?

A) Check the proof of work  
B) Verify the block hash  
C) Validate all transactions

## **True/False Questions**

### **Question 9**
A block header contains all the metadata needed to identify and validate a block.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 10**
Transaction interfaces in Go must be explicitly implemented by declaring that a type implements the interface.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 11**
Merkle trees allow you to verify that a transaction is included in a block without downloading the entire block.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 12**
Wallet private keys should be stored in plain text for easy access.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 13**
PUIDs are used to provide unique identifiers that persist across blockchain operations.

**True** / **False**

### **Question 14**
Block size calculation is important for network transmission and storage efficiency.

**True** / **False**

## **Practical Questions**

### **Question 15: Block Structure Implementation**
Create a complete block structure with header and body separation. Include all necessary fields and implement the hash calculation method.

### **Question 16: Transaction Interface Design**
Design a transaction interface and implement two different transaction types (Bank and Message) that satisfy the interface.

### **Question 17: Wallet System Implementation**
Implement a wallet system with key generation, address derivation, and balance tracking functionality.

### **Question 18: Merkle Tree Implementation**
Create a function that builds a Merkle tree from a list of transaction hashes and returns the root hash.
