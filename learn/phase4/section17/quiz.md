D) Cloud Integration / Cloud Deployment

### **Question 5: Semantic Versioning**
In semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), what does a PATCH version change indicate?

A) Breaking changes that require migration  
B) New features that are backward compatible  
C) Bug fixes and minor improvements  
D) Complete rewrite of the application

### **Question 6: Kubernetes Deployment**
What is the primary purpose of a Kubernetes Deployment?

A) To store application data  
B) To manage and scale application replicas  
C) To provide network connectivity  
D) To manage user authentication

### **Question 7: Health Checks**
What is the purpose of health checks in containerized applications?

A) To monitor system resources  
B) To verify that the application is running correctly  
C) To automatically restart failed containers  
D) To collect user analytics

### **Question 8: Release Management**
What is the main goal of release management?

## **True/False Questions**

### **Question 9**
A Makefile can only be used for building Go applications.

### **Question 10**
Docker containers are always smaller than virtual machines.

### **Question 11**
Continuous Integration automatically runs tests on every code commit.

### **Question 12**
Kubernetes can automatically scale applications based on demand.

### **Question 13**
Semantic versioning helps users understand the impact of updates.

### **Question 14**

## **Practical Questions**

### **Question 15: Makefile Implementation**
Create a professional Makefile that includes:
- Build targets for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Test and linting targets
- Docker build and run targets
- Clean and help targets
- Development workflow automation

### **Question 16: Docker Containerization**
Design a multi-stage Dockerfile that:

- Creates a minimal production image
- Includes health checks
- Runs as a non-root user
- Optimizes for security and size

### **Question 17: CI/CD Pipeline Design**
Create a CI/CD pipeline configuration that:
- Runs tests on every commit
- Builds Docker images automatically
- Deploys to staging and production environments
- Includes security scanning
- Sends notifications on deployment status

### **Question 18: Kubernetes Deployment**
Design Kubernetes manifests for a production deployment that includes:
- Deployment with multiple replicas
- Service for network access
- Ingress for external access
- Resource limits and requests
- Health checks and monitoring
